# LuxSignals

> “Empowering Traders with AI”

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

LuxSignals is a SaaS platform that delivers clean, actionable trading signals directly inside TradingView. As co-founder and lead on branding & design, I crafted every visual and user experience element to position LuxSignals as the go-to authority for beginner and intermediate traders.

## 🎨 Branding & Visual Identity

- **Logo & Wordmark**  
  I designed a minimalist logotype using a custom-modified geometric sans (Satoshi) paired with an accent serif (Fraunces) for tagline treatments. The logomark—a stylized “L” formed by two overlapping arrows—symbolizes our dual focus on buy/sell signals.  
- **Color Palette**  
  - **Deep Purple** for trust & innovation  
  - **Charcoal Gray** for professional grounding  
  - **Ivory White** for clarity & contrast  
- **Iconography**  
  Created a set of line-based icons (signal waves, chart lines, alert badges) to unify the dashboard, marketing site, and social assets.

## 💻 Website & UX Design

1. **Landing Page**  
   - Full-width hero with a subtle parallax chart animation  
   - Clear “Get Started” CTA that opens account signup  
2. **Feature Sections**  
   - Modular grid layout: each feature (real-time signals, backtest analytics, educational resources) sits in a hard-edged, perfectly aligned card  
   - Hover interactions built with Framer Motion: scale-up + fade-in details  
3. **Dashboard Prototype**  
   - High-fidelity Figma mockups translated into a Next.js / Tailwind CSS frontend  
   - Dark/light mode toggle with sharp sun/moon icon in the nav  
   - Responsive table and chart components using Recharts

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Workflow

- **Next.js (App Router)** for SSR, routing & MDX page rendering  
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom type & color tokens  
- **Framer Motion** for polished page transitions and micro-animations  
- **Figma → React** handoff via Anima (tight iteration cycle)  
- **Vercel** for CI/CD & instantaneous deploy previews

## 📈 Impact & Learnings

- **Brand Lift:** 30% increase in sign-ups after launching new visual identity  
- **Engagement:** Average session duration up 45% with interactive signal demos  
- **Process Wins:**  
  - Established a reusable design system (cards, buttons, icons) that scales to new features  
  - Streamlined handoff, reducing design←→dev friction by 50%
